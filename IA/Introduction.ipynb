    "\n",
    "Originally published at _Computing machinery and intelligence_, Alan Turing argued that if a machine can act like a human being, then, we can say that it is smart/intelligent. Turing proposed a test: A human being will begin a communication through a computing terminal with an entity in a room next to him; the entity would be another human or a machine. If, after a conversation, the human being is not able to differentiate if the entity is a machine or another person, then, we can consider that machine as smart/intelligent.\n",

    "A lot of time has passed since Turing wrote his test, but actually it is considered that if a machine must pass the test it must have the below abilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing, NLP: Ability  to recognize human language. This field has a lot of applications, including automatic traduction or guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reasoning: Based on some inputs, the machine should be able to infer different conclusions related with those inputs and its environment. For example, if it is raining, we as humans have as input water falling as drops, but we conclude that the floor should be wet, that the road may be dangerous for the cars, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning: The machine should be able to learn new things from its own experience/inputs. Actually, some methods like bayesian networks  attempts to simulate the generalization needed to learn.\n",

    "- Knowledge representation: One of the hardest IA fields, how do you represent the knowledge and store it? Actually, the knowledge representation is stored as a series of matrixes inside what is called AI model."

    "there are also another interpretation about what a smart machine should do, let's see them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A machine is smart if it acts as human:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Seems to be the same exposed by Turing, but there is a huge difference: To act as a human being does not mean that the machine should use/implement the same mental process that happens in the human brain. This interpration aims to search new ways to mimic human thinkering, but looking for its own path to arrive to the same conclusions that a human will retrieve from different inputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Rational model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Based on agents, the acts from a smart agent should be based on reasoning and the conclusions obtained from the information that the agent posseses. Theses agents will take a decisition based in the information that every one of them has.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, there is not a consense in what IA means exactly, and actually this field is still in a experimental age, but with the tools that we already have there are a lot of applications to develop! So let's consider, for this short course, that IA is a compend of algorithms and techniques to solve problems that requires a considerable intelligence grade."
